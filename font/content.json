Actually you just before going abroad, I remember I told you almost ran over with you, I love you you told me I was direct at that time, actually, at that time I was quite surprised for myself, because I also didn't seem so direct to the girl that confessional precedent, I also don't know oneself which come of courage, but it can be a happy feeling. I kept hoping it wasn't a whim, and now I'm feeling more and more like it wasn't. Speaking of what I like about you, I like your smile, like your personality, and more like the feeling that you bring to me when we chat sometimes. But we know each other is short, also do not know at present an idea in your mind, after all, even together we also have a long way to go, so I just take advantage of this day to give you "dedication", I hope to let you more confidence in me ~ Happy Tanabata!"
